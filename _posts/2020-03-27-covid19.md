Because of the major impact the SARS2 infection has on our society right now, I grabbed the data of the [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and looked at [them](https://klprint.github.io/covid19/corona-outbreak-analysis.html).

In the beginning, the exponential growth in all of the countries, reporting cases, was very obvious.

Now, many countries took measures to `#FlattenTheCurve' which seems to reduce the infections per days after about one week of lag-phase.
