# Kevin Leiss

Born in 1991 I grew up in a small village close to Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany.
After my Abitur I studied biosciences (BSc.), followed by my Master Thesis in molecular biosciences in Heidelberg.
During my studies I fell in love with bioinformatics and thanks to the support of [Prof. Dr. Christine Clayton](https://www.zmbh.uni-heidelberg.de/clayton/default.shtml) I was able to start my transition from wet-lab to dry-lab biology.
I did my master thesis in her lab, where I studied the transcriptome of *Trypanosoma brucei* isolated from various sources and compared these to blood stream forms of lab strains [^1].
